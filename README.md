# Token Gated Website

This project demonstrates how we can restrict content on our website to only those users who own a token of your choice (any ERC-20, ERC-721 or ERC-1155).



## Tools:

- [React SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react): To access the connected wallet, switch the user's network, and claim an NFT from our Edition Drop collection.
- [Auth](https://portal.thirdweb.com/auth): To ask users to sign a message and verify they own the wallet they claim to be, while on the server-side.
